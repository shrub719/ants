# 🐜
Resources for the 2026 AQA A level CS skeleton program.

## How to use

`src/master`: the original code, and an annotated copy with docstrings and comments.

`src/tasks`: several mock Section C questions. Each folder contains the task itself in `README.md` and the completed code in `main.py`.

## Licensing

This is AQA's code, so I claim nothing as my own. My solutions are free to use as AQA allows.
